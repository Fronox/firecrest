    "This task will be split into more steps but it will correspond to one FirecREST task, so we have to keep track of one task ID.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. the user asks FirecREST for a link to the staging area\n",
    "2. the user uploads the file to the staging area\n",
    "3. FirecREST will poll the staging area and, as soon as the file is uploaded it will transfer it to the filesystem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to send a `POST` request to FirecREST, to the `/storage/xfer-external/upload` endpoint. Besides the `Authorization` token, we have to include the local path of the file we are going to upload (`sourcePath`) and the target location of the transfer (`targetPath`). Both `sourcePath` and `targetPath` are form data parameters.\n",
