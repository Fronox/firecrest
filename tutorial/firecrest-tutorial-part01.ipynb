    "### HTTP requests basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting using the API it's important we are all familiar with HTTP requests and how they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "FirecREST API is based on REST principles: data resources are accessed via standard HTTP requests to an API endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every request is made of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the endpoint or requested URL\n",
    "- the method (one of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE depending on the appropriate action)\n",
    "- the headers (metadata necessary for the request)\n",
    "- the body (form data, files to be uploaded, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessary information for every call is passed through query parameters, the headers and the body of the request. You can find all the available API calls of FirecREST in the reference section and here is a quick overview of the methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method | Description\n",
    ":---: | :---\n",
    "GET | Used for retrieving resources.\n",
    "POST | Used for creating/updating resources.\n",
    "PUT | Used for creating/updating resources.*\n",
    "DELETE | Used for deleting resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the requests, the response of FirecREST will consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a status code\n",
    "- the headers\n",
    "- the body in json form\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick overview of the status codes and their meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# | Category | Description\n",
    ":---: | :--- | :---\n",
    "1xx | Informational | Communicates transfer protocol-level information.\n",
    "2xx | Success | Indicates that the client’s request was accepted successfully.\n",
    "3xx | Redirection | Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete their request.\n",
    "4xx | Client Error | This category of error status codes points the finger at clients.\n",
    "5xx | Server Error | The server takes responsibility for these error status codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Setup\n",

    "For this tutorial we are all going to use the same service account on Piz Daint, `firectut`. To avoid conflicts, you will all work in different directories of this user. Make sure you set the fields in the following cell and run the cell.\n",
