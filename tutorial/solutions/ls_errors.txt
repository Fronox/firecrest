1. The response header will include: "X-Invalid-Path": "/home/llama2 is an invalid path"

2. The response header will include: "X-Permission-Denied": "User does not have permissions to access machine or path"

In both cases the json will be the same:
{
    "description": "Error listing contents of path"
}
