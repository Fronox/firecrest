1. Squeue only displays active slurm jobs.
   The job we submitted is so fast that it has already finished.
   You can add in your jobscript some delay, with the sleep command,
   so that you have enough time to perform the calls and get
   an active job.

2. FirecREST has created the task but it hasn't submitted the
   job to slurm yet. This is why you see the task as "Queued".
