1. Squeue only displays active slurm jobs.
   If you got this error, you can add in your jobscript more delay,
   with the sleep command, so that you have enough time to perform
   the calls and get an active job.

   The alternative is to use the `sacct` command of slurm.

2. FirecREST has created the task but it hasn't submitted the
   job to slurm yet. This is why you see the task as "Queued".
