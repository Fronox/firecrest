FirecREST in a nutshell
=======================

FirecREST is a web-enabled application programming interface (API)  to  High-Performance  Computing  (HPC)  resources  under development at CSCS.

Scientific platform developers can integrate the Firecrest API into their  web-enabled  portals  and  applications,  allowing  them  to securely  access  authenticated  and  authorized  CSCS  services such  as  job  submission,  data  mover  and  transfer  on  HPC systems.
