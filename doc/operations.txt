Operations:

Docker images:

There're 4 images used:
- Centos:7   base for all microservices (except Kong, QueuePersistance). Python and several pip packages are taken from them. It also uses EPEL repository
- Redis:5    used for QueuePersistance. Doesn't depend on any specific Redis feature of this version, but python-redis used to access it may depend.
- Kong:1.0   stable release, nothing especific. Should be possible to upgrade without issues.


Microservices (except Kong, QueuePersistance) adds EPEL repository, install pip and add several packages, mainly Flask and pyjwt.

QueuePersistance is the only container which requires disk space to store its data. 


Startup and shutdown order:
Queue requires QueuePersistance to be up before starting. Other services can be started/stoped in any order, but for functionality there're dependecies:
- Certificator: none
- Jobs: depends on Queue, Certificator
- Status: none
- Storage: depends on Queue, Jobs, Certificator
- Utilities: depends on Certificator
